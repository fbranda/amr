## About the Data <a name="Data"></a>

### Data sources for humans infections

1) Europe: [AMR dashboard](http://tinyurl.com/who-dashboard-amr), created by the WHO European Office; 
2) Italy: [Istituto Superiore di Sanità (ISS)](https://www.epicentro.iss.it/antibiotico-resistenza/)

### Data sources for animals infections
<b>What is resistancebank.org?</b>
[resistancebank.org](https://resistancebank.org/) is an online repository for point prevalence surveys on AMR in animals, with a focus on low and middle-income countries. It is aimed at providing the scientific community with a focal point to share information on AMR, and to help inform evidence-based policies by making global maps of AMR available to the public.

What are the hotspots of AMR?
The hotspots of AMR represents the proportion of antimicrobials used in each location (pixel) with resistance higher than 50% (P50). For details on the methodology for terrestrial animals in South America, Africa, and Asia, see Van Boeckel & Pires, 2019. Global Trends in Antimicrobial Resistance in Animals in Low- and Middle-Income Countries, Science 365 (6459) (the P50 map will be updated on a yearly basis). For details on the methodology for terrestrial animals in Europe, see Mulchandani et al., 2024. Predictive Mapping of Antimicrobial Resistance for Escherichia coli, Salmonella, and Campylobacter in Food-Producing Animals, Europe, 2000–2021, Emerging Infectious Diseases 30 (1).
For details on the methodology for aquatic animals, see Schar et al., 2021. Twenty-year trends in antimicrobial resistance from aquaculture and fisheries in Asia, Nature Communications 12 (5384).

What can you do to help?
If you have published or are preparing a point prevalence survey, you can deposit your data in resistancebank.org using the ‘Add your survey’ button. Your name and your study will appear on the interactive map. For information on uploading surveys, see Criscuolo et al., 2021. resistancebank.org, an open-access repository for surveys of antimicrobial resistance in animals, Scientific Data 8 (189).
